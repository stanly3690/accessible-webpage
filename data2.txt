The Clear-View Head Pointer, model 6000, is a head pointer designed for use by individuals with spinal cord injury or upper extremity disabilities or severe physical disabilities. This head pointer projects out at jaw level. The design of extending the pointer from jaw level rather than forehead level places the pointer in closer proximity to the object being selected, and does not interrupt the user's field of vision during use. The lightweight aluminum yoke can be bent to adjust pointer angle. The contoured unit is adjustable six ways via side knobs for control and comfort. DIMENSIONS: 20.25 inches long from ear to tip. Wand is 10 inches long.
